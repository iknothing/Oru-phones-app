# ASSIGNMENT

## Problem Statement

We would like to evaluate your skills in **Flutter**, including UI design, API handling, and memory management.

## Getting Started

To run the app, navigate to the root directory of the project (`cd oruphonesapp`) and run the command `flutter run!`.

## Implemented Features

* The app uses the **MVC** pattern and **provider** as a state management solution.
* The app can search for products from the backend database.
* The app can fetch 10 products with on-scroll pagination.
* The app can get filters.

## Image Optimization

The app uses image optimization techniques with the `cached_network_image` library to store images in cache format. This prevents the same image from being downloaded multiple times, which saves server bandwidth and increases the speed of the app.

## Memory Management

The app uses the `streamproviders` package to automatically handle memory and dispose of all data after the widget lifecycle is over. This helps to prevent unnecessary memory leaks and usage of resources, such as RAM, ROM, and battery.

The app is still under development, and we plan to add many more features in the future. We are also open to feedback from other developers.
